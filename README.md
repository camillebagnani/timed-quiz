# Timed Quiz

## Description

This timed quiz was created to utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web API best practices. Its purpose is to take users through a timed quiz about photography. They are give 60 seconds to answer every question. If they get the answer wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted. The questions advance whether the user gets the answer right or not. Once the quiz is over, they will be prompt to enter their intials. From there, they will be taken to a high score page where the local storage has saved their initials and the time it took them to complete the quiz (i.e. their score). This project helped me further practice my JavaScript skills such as functions, variables, if statements, for loops and more. It taught me how to use the DOM to add HTML elements via JavaScript, with methods like appendChild and createElement and properties like textContent and innerHTML. It also taught me how to use the setInterval and clearInterval functions to make a timer, and how to use event listeners to make my buttons function.

## Installation

## Usage

To begin the quiz, click the 'Start Quiz' button. Once clicked, the timer will begin and the first question will appear simultaneously. Select one of four multiple choice options to answer the question. Wrong answers will be penalized by docking 10 seconds from the time. Your final score will be the time left. After the last question, users will be prompted to enter their initials, and will be taken to the high score page.
